randomcalendars
===============

Re-implementation of [Hilary's random calendar generator](https://github.com/hilaryparker/GenerateCalendar) using the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/).  This implementation allows for more automation (e.g., directly creates calendars rather than requiring users to manually upload a csv file; contains an algorithm to automatically handle TA conflicts) and is done in Python rather than R.
